Design a modern and stylish baseball uniform for LG Twins that appeals to the MZ generation, incorporating elements of both retro and urban aesthetics. The uniform should feature LG Twins' iconic stripes in a sleek and bold way, while maintaining a clean, minimalistic look that resonates with young, trendy fans. The colors should primarily be red, black, and white, with a touch of metallic or neon accents to add a futuristic vibe. Additionally, incorporate urban elements to reflect Seoul, the team's home city, like subtle cityscape patterns or architectural motifs on the sleeves or collar. The design should also have retro elements, such as vintage-style fonts, classic logos, or throwback features that tie into the growing nostalgia trend, making the uniform both timeless and modern. The overall look should strike a perfect balance between the team's tradition and contemporary trends, making it appealing to both long-time fans and new, younger supporters.
